Application for people looking for new dining experiences

People have problems finding new restaurants, or finding the incentive to try new experiences with food. 

This app not only provides a user with several options, but by incentivizing them as "quests" encourages users to hit new milestones by trying things outside their comfort zone.

User stories: 

Jane just wants to make decision about dinner.
She doesn't care about the incentives, but the app begins with three choices already presented. She can use the app to quickly make a choice about dinner in her area.

Ted is a foodie, and but he wishes that he could broaden himself a bit.
He logs into the app using his gmail account, and creates a character. After answering a few questions, he gets his first set of "quests," and immediately picks the one with the highest reward. This should be the one farthest outside his comfort zone.

Thomas likes to make things into games and italian food.
He uses the app to find italian food places around the area, and then checks them off in the app, building a log of the places he's visited.

Melanie has a reputation for knowing the best places to eat in town, and is very competitive.
She builds a character over time to show off to her friends, eventually sharing her kitted-out wizard on social media to her friends.
